# KVS Storage
This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS.

* [/androidApp](./androidApp/src) contains Android applications.
* [/iosApp](./iosApp/iosApp) contains iOS applications. Even if youâ€™re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform,
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.

* [/shared](./shared/src) is for the code that will be shared between all targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is [commonMain](./shared/src/commonMain/kotlin). If preferred, you can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.

## Important Configuration Steps When Using This Template

When creating a new project based on this template, you need to modify the following:

1.  **Project Name in settings.gradle.kts:**
    *   Open the `settings.gradle.kts` file in the root of your project.
    *   Change the `rootProject.name` attribute to your desired project name.
        ```kotlin
        rootProject.name = "YourNewProjectName"
        ```

2.  **Android Application ID:**
    *   Open the `build.gradle.kts` file located in the `androidApp` module (`./androidApp/build.gradle.kts`).
    *   Modify the `applicationId` within the `defaultConfig` block to your unique application ID.
        ```kotlin
        android {
            // ...
            defaultConfig {
                applicationId = "com.yourcompany.yournewprojectname"
                // ...
            }
            // ...
        }
        ```

3.  **iOS Configuration (Config.xcconfig):**
    *   Open the `Config.xcconfig` file located in the `iosApp/Configuration` directory (`./iosApp/Configuration/Config.xcconfig`).
    *   Update the necessary values such as `APP_ID` (Bundle ID) and `APP_NAME` (Display Name) with your project-specific information.
        ```
        APP_ID = com.yourcompany.YourNewProjectName
        APP_NAME = YourNewProjectName
        ```

## Verify Your Environment

It is recommended to install and run [kdoctor](https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor) to verify that your development environment is correctly set up for Kotlin Multiplatform development. `kdoctor` helps diagnose and fix common configuration issues.
